		<h2 class="title">About</h2>
		<p>
			Introduction to machine learning, providing a probabilistic view on artificial intelligence and reasoning
			under uncertainty. Topics include: supervised learning, ensemble methods and boosting, neural networks,
			support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering and unsupervised learning, maximum likelihood,
			graphical models, hidden Markov models, inference methods, and computational learning theory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Students should feel comfortable with multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability theory,
			and complexity theory. Students will be required to produce non-trivial programs in Python.
